Artie 3000 is a toy robot plotter. 
You put a felt pen thorugh him, then thorugh a series of simple commands (penup, pendown, left (angle), forward (amount), you can program him to draw things.
The [codewithartie.com website has some examples of alphabet letters](https://codewithartie.com/downloads.html#UI-instructions), but they don't all terminate in the same position, making it difficult to write sentences with Artie.

The code on here was tweaked from the examples on the site.

## To write your own sentence do the following

Download 1.txt, and copy the text into Artie's Javascript editor.

Change the line:
`var str = "I CAN WRITE ANYTHING"; /// string to write!`
to whatever string you want, using capital letters and spaces only (at the moment).

To adjust the size of the text, alter the first line of the code:
`var unit = 4;`

## Still to do

* Alter the code to do a pen up every time there's a big rotation (this slows down writing speed, but reduces ink blobs)
* Add more symbols, punctuation, lower case letters.
* Add easily variable spacing between letters.

## Don't expect too much
Arite is a fun toy, but a pretty terrible plotter. As you can see in the youtube video, the text drifts, lines don't meet up where they should, and the ink blobs on the paper when he is rotating, and quite often just for the fun of it, even when the pen is up.

Feel free to fork any of this and reuse however you wish!  Let me know if you manage to make it work better!
